## Introduction

This repository documents my journey through various TryHackMe labs and challenges. The goal is to demonstrate my practical skills in cybersecurity, including network scanning, vulnerability analysis, exploitation, and privilege escalation.

## Lab Write-ups

### [Lab 1: Basic Pentesting](labs/basic-pentesting/README.md)
- Objective: Gain root access to the machine.
- Skills: Network scanning, web enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation.

### [Lab 2: OWASP Top 10](labs/owasp-top-10/README.md)
- Objective: Identify and exploit common web vulnerabilities.
- Skills: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.

### [Lab 3: Active Directory Basics](labs/ad-basics/README.md)
- Objective: Understand and exploit basic Active Directory configurations.
- Skills: LDAP enumeration, Kerberos attacks, privilege escalation.

### [Lab 4: Linux Privilege Escalation](labs/linux-priv-esc/README.md)
- Objective: Escalate privileges on a Linux machine.
- Skills: SUID binaries, misconfigured services, kernel exploits.

### [Lab 5: Windows Privilege Escalation](labs/windows-priv-esc/README.md)
- Objective: Escalate privileges on a Windows machine.
- Skills: Registry exploits, misconfigured services, token impersonation.

## Tools and Techniques
